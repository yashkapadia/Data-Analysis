# Prediction-of-Customer-Satisfaction-using-Airline-data
Leverage machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction. This project was part of my Applied Data Science course 
at Syracuse University

## Motivation
As a mean transportation in our life, airplane could save our time during the trip. The flights are not blocked by mountains, rivers, deserts and oceans. With the development of economy, there is a growing concern over the feedback from the customers about its satisfaction. It will affect the customerâ€™s choice about which flight company which they are going to pick in the fierce competition.

At this time, a survey could directly collect the real feedback from customer, to evaluating their flight, measuring their loyalty, figure out their preference. This project analyzes the satisfaction survey about their flight experience and predicts the satisfaction using the past survey data.

The goal of this project is to identify factors affecting satisfaction of airline customers to improve the customer service and business operations of the airline comapanies
